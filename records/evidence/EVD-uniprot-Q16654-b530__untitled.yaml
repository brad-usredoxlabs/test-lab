    id: ASN-pdk4-phosphorylates-pdha1-324b
    type: assertion
    label: Human PDK4 phosphorylates the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit
      PDHA1.
  - kind: record
    id: ASN-pdk4-phosphorylates-pdha2-fe18
    type: assertion
    label: Human PDK4 phosphorylates the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit
      PDHA2.
  - kind: record
    id: ASN-pdk4-inhibits-pdh-activity-c3ed
    type: assertion
    label: PDK4 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase activity via phosphorylation of
      pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits.
  - kind: record
    id: ASN-pdk4-regulates-tca-flux-a77b
    type: assertion
    label: PDK4 regulates metabolite flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle by
      inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase.
  - kind: record
    id: ASN-pdk4-decreases-glucose-utilization-8328
    type: assertion
    label: During prolonged fasting or starvation, inhibition of pyruvate
      dehydrogenase by PDK4 decreases glucose utilization and increases fat
      metabolism.

    id: ASN-pdk4-involved-insulin-signaling-76ca
    type: assertion
    label: PDK4 is involved in the insulin signaling cascade.
  - kind: record
    id: ASN-pdk4-promotes-ros-generation-8a49
    type: assertion
    label: PDK4 plays a role in the generation of reactive oxygen species.
  - kind: record
