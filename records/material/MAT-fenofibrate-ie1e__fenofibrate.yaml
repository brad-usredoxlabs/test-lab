definition: A synthetic phenoxy-isobutyric acid derivate and prodrug with
  antihyperlipidemic activity. Fenofibrate is hydrolyzed in vivo to its active
  metabolite fenofibric acid that binds to and activates peroxisome proliferator
  activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), resulting in the activation of
  lipoprotein lipase and reduction of the production of apoprotein C-III, an
  inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity. Increased lipolysis and a fall in
  plasma triglycerides, in turn, leads to the modification of the small, dense
  low density lipoporotein (LDL) particles into larger particles that are
  catabolized more rapidly due to a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors.
  In addition, activation of PPARalpha also increases the synthesis of
  apoproteins A-I, A-II, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol.
  Overall, fenofibrate reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
  apolipoprotein B, total triglycerides and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL)
  while increasing HDL cholesterol.
