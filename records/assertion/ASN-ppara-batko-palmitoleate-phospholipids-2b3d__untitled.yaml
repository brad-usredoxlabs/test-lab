  type: claim
  label: Deletion of PPARα increases palmitoleate in phospholipids.
statement: Lipid profiles in phospholipids differ in PPARαBATKO mice, including
  increased palmitoleate, suggesting altered membrane lipid composition.
scope: {}
outcome:
  measure: Phospholipid lipidomics (palmitoleate abundance)
  direction: increased
